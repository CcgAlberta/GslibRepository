GSLIB is an acronym for Geostatistical Software LIBrary. This name was originally used for a collection of geostatistical programs developed at Stanford University over the last 15 years. The original GSLIB inspired the writing of GSLIB: Geostatistical Software Library and User's Guide by Clayton Deutsch and Andre Journel, 1992, 340 pp. during 1990 - 1992. The second edition was completed in 1997. Both editions were published by Oxford University Press.
